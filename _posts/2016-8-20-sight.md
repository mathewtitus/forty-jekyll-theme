Seeing someone can be both a weapon, a transitive action, a bolt launched, or a communal meeting of two people. Carol Shields refers to the former, speaking of a look as if it removed language from communication in the same way text messaging removed sound from it. David Whyte refers to a different form of seeing that has little to do with language at all. It is not a measuring of someone, it is not a plea or an invitation, it is a meditation on the other person. An acknowledgement if it is anything other than the two being with one another.

I imagine the layers, id -> ego -> superego: it seems to me that Shields' glance is an animal communication, an intuition dependent on and distributed across two bodies. Whyte's "seeing" one another exists on the higher plane of superego: allowing one's history (which has defined given context to our actions on all three layers) to be laid bare before another person, and to bear witness to their life in turn. To be bare and to witness.
