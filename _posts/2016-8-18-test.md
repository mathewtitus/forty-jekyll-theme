Life after the Ph.D.

My first twenty-two years were a tour de force - I breezed through academic challenges, feeling very little real competition in english, math, the sciences, or history. Though I entered high school with no close friends with some passing sports involvement and having formed a tight circle of friends I left high school as something of an icon to lower classmen, an academic leader (albeit with two B's ousting me from valedictorian/salutatorian status - from study hall and geometry, classes which required a certain amount of accountability, or as I saw it, self-directed busy work).

In undergraduate I again skipped a math class and, after dabbling in a foreign language major, launched myself into the major that I thought sounded the most challenging: physics. It required only a small change to tack on a dual math major as well, so I did this, though I mainly considered myself a physicist and had some disregard for the more abstract aspects of mathematics such as real analysis (topology and geometry being very tangible and relatable to physics).
